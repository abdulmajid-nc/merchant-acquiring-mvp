# Styling Standardization

This pull request addresses styling inconsistencies between the Analytics Dashboard and Admin Panel components.

## Changes Made

1. Created standardized reusable components:
   - `StatsCard.js`: A unified component for displaying metric cards
   - `TransactionTable.js`: A standardized table component for displaying transactions
   - `StatusBadge.js`: A comprehensive component for displaying all types of status badges
   - `TransactionStatusBadge.js`: Updated to use StatusBadge for backward compatibility

2. Updated both Analytics and Admin Panel pages to use these components, ensuring:
   - Consistent card styling (rounded corners, shadows, borders)
   - Unified transaction table layout
   - Consistent status badge rendering across all status types:
     - Transaction statuses (Approved, Pending, etc.)
     - System health statuses (Operational, Degraded, etc.)
     - Compliance statuses (Compliant, Non-Compliant)
   - Uniform padding and spacing

3. Enhanced status handling:
   - Added SYSTEM_STATUSES constants in transactionConstants.js
   - Improved status badge styling options (normal and highlighted variants)
   - Added support for icons in status badges

4. Benefits:
   - Improved visual consistency across the application
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Easier maintenance when styling needs to be updated
   - Better user experience with consistent UI patterns
   - Enhanced flexibility for status badge styling variants
