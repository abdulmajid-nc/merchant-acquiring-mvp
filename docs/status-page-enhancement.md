# Status Page Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Status Page Enhancement**
   - Updated the `/status` page to support both merchant and transaction status checks
   - Added a toggle to switch between merchant and transaction status queries
   - Improved UI with better feedback and status information

2. **Backend API**
   - Created a new `transactionsController.js` with CRUD operations for transactions
   - Added a new route file `transactions.js` to handle transaction endpoints
   - Registered the new routes in `app.js`

3. **API Integration**
   - Added new endpoints to the frontend API utilities
   - Updated the Status component to use the new transaction endpoints

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Users can now check both merchant and transaction statuses from a single interface
   - The UI is clearer about what kind of status is being checked

2. **API Consistency**
   - Transaction APIs now follow the same pattern as other APIs in the system
   - Backend has proper controller separation and route organization

2. Use the toggle to switch between "Merchant Status" and "Transaction Status"
3. Enter a valid ID for either a merchant or transaction
4. Click "Check Status" to see the results

## Future Enhancements
