# Frontend Changes Log

## Bootstrap and React-DatePicker Fix

### Summary
Fixed issues with the frontend build by:
1. Correctly configuring DatePicker component and its dependencies
2. Removing incorrect Tailwind CSS references (the project is using Bootstrap)

### Changes Made
1. Fixed `postcss.config.js` to remove incorrect Tailwind configuration
2. Updated `package.json` to remove Tailwind dependencies 
3. Fixed `MerchantPricing.js` to properly import and use the DatePicker component
4. Replaced Tailwind directives in `index.css` with Bootstrap comments
5. Added clear documentation for how to install dependencies
6. Fixed installation script to only install required dependencies

### How to Test
1. Run the frontend installation script:
```bash
cd frontend
./install-deps.sh
```
2. Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
3. Navigate to the Merchant Pricing section and verify the DatePicker works correctly

### Notes
- The application was incorrectly configured with Tailwind CSS dependencies despite actually using Bootstrap
- All Tailwind-related files and references have been removed or modified accordingly
- The DatePicker component now correctly imports its CSS styling
